# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/Alexander-Palomares/Threat-Hunting-Scenario-Tor/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

I began by querying the DeviceFileEvents table, filtering for any entries containing the string ‚Äútor‚Äù. This led to the discovery that user alexanderp had downloaded a Tor installer. Multiple Tor-related files were copied to the desktop, and a text file named tor-shopping-list.txt was created. These events began at 2025-04-14T23:00:23.1664006Z.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "alexanderp"
| where FileName contains "tor"
| where Timestamp >= todatetime('2025-04-14T23:00:23.1664006Z')
| order by Timestamp desc 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

After identifying the suspicious user alexanderp, I used the previously gathered context to query the DeviceProcessEvents table. I filtered for processes initiated by this user and command lines containing references to ‚Äútor‚Äù. This revealed the execution of tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.9.exe, a portable version of the Tor Browser for 64-bit Windows. This version runs without installation and supports silent execution.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where AccountName == "alexanderp"
| where FileName == "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.9.exe" 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

I continued investigating the DeviceProcessEvents table for additional evidence that alexanderp had executed the Tor Browser. At 2025-04-14T23:05:26.9374591Z, I observed the launch of firefox.exe (used by the Tor Browser) followed by multiple instances of tor.exe, confirming active use.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where AccountName == "alexanderp"
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

I queried the DeviceNetworkEvents table to identify any network activity indicating Tor Browser usage over known Tor-related ports. At 2025-04-14T23:06:06.81814Z, the user on the threat-hunt-lab device established a successful connection to 127.0.0.1 on port 9150. Additional connections were observed on port 9001, initiated by tor.exe, along with outbound traffic over port 443, confirming active Tor network communication.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "alexanderp"
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9041", "9051", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ( "firefox.exe", "tor.exe")
| project Timestamp, ActionType, DeviceName, RemoteIP, RemotePort, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| order by Timestamp desc 
```
